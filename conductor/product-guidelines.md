# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Concise & Friendly:** We communicate with our users using clear, welcoming, and simple language. Our goal is to make text-to-speech technology approachable while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Branding & Visual Identity
- **macOS Native Experience:** Kookie is designed to feel like a natural extension of the macOS desktop. We prioritize system-standard UI elements, respect user preferences (like Dark Mode), and ensure a clean, integrated aesthetic.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Performance-driven UX:** Speed is at the heart of the experience. We optimize for low-latency synthesis and immediate playback, ensuring the app remains responsive even when handling large text files or PDF imports.
- **Simplicity:** We favor minimalist designs that put the content (text and voice) at the center of the user's focus.

## Engineering & Quality
- **Test-driven Development (TDD):** We follow a rigorous testing culture to ensure stability and reliability. New features should be accompanied by tests that verify functionality, performance, and cross-module integration.
- **Local Integrity:** As a local-first application, we prioritize robust asset management and secure, efficient handling of models and audio files on the user's local filesystem.
